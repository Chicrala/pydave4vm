Hello,

As I publish this work here I expect that people who aim to contribute to do it in an organized way so that we can have a 
better working code in the end. Also, don't forget to add your comments explaining what you are configuring the code to do.

Any queries feel free to reach me in my email: andre.silva@northumbria.ac.uk

Kind Regards,
Andre
